# Advanced SmartOS Management Daemon
asmd aims to replace a few bash glue services 
 i have for my personal SmartOS nodes.

The following will be implemented:

* /root setup :: dump some files in root's home e.g. .bashrc
* admin tag over vnic :: support for the admin tag to be over a vnic
* cron 
* notify helper :: setup sendmail for fowarding
